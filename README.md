# EHD-PROJECT-MUSIC-PLAYER-
Wavepad is a gesture and voice controlled music player. It is built using Raspberry pi board. With Wavepad we can increase and decrease the volume of the song, play next song, play previous song, pause and resume song. We can also use voice commands to change the current playing song to the song which we wish to play.
